-  `equals()` method in Java, or `==` operator in Kotlin, is a comparison of values, called structural equality.

- `==` operator in Java, or `===` in Kotlin, is a comparison of references, called referential equality. 

- Referential equality compares references and returns true if the two references are identical—that is, they refer to the same exact instance. The operator `===` in Kotlin is a direct equivalent of the `==` operator in Java.
