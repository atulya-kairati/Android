### Immutable Variable (`val`)

- Creates constants.
```kotlin
val pi: Double = 3.0

// or

val pi = 3.0

pi = 3.14 // will give error
```
- Type declaration is optional, since the type is inferred.
- `val` is similar to `final` in Java.


### Mutable Variable (`var`)
- Can be reassigned.
```kotlin
var c = 0

c = c * 2
```
